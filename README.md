# Lisualizer
Audio visualizer based on sound localization

(Work in progress) An open-source, cross-platform audio visualization software that will use virtual sound localization in an effort to create more effective and impactful visualizations of audio. These visualizations will display many of the graphical effects commonly seen in other music and audio visualization software. However, unlike other visualization software available, this software will also take into account the perceived source locations of each sound present in the audio clip.
